# Multi-Element-Linked-List

The project is Java based and requires the creation of a multi-element linked list. The idea is to have something like below:

The number of nodes of the linked list would be dynamic. Meaning if the user enter 10, the program will create 10 nodes in the list. 
However, within each node, the number of elements would be static(5).
